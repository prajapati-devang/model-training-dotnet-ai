# 🧠 .NET AI Sentiment Analyzer (.NET 10 & Blazor Server)

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end implementation of a custom Machine Learning model built with **ML.NET** and integrated into a **Blazor Server** web application using **.NET 10**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Custom AI Model:** A binary classification model trained to detect sentiment (Positive/Negative).
- **High Performance:** Utilizes `.NET 10` optimizations and `PredictionEnginePool` for thread-safe, scalable web inference.
- **Real-time UI:** A reactive Blazor interface that provides instant feedback and confidence scores.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`ModelTrainer/`**: A C# Console Application used to train, evaluate, and export the ML model.
- **`SentimentWebApp/`**: A Blazor Server application that consumes the trained model.
- **`SentimentModel.zip`**: The serialized AI model (generated by the trainer).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Prerequisites
- **Framework:** .NET 10 SDK
- **Library:** ML.NET (Microsoft.ML)
- **Extensions:** Microsoft.Extensions.ML (for Object Pooling in Blazor)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022 (v17.12+) or VS Code

## 🚦 Getting Started

### 1. First creata training model by runing the console App.
Before running the web app, you must generate the model file.
1. Navigate to the trainer directory:
   ```bash
   cd ModelTrainer


### 2. Running the Training model
Run the training logic.
1. Navigate to the trainer directory:
   ```bash
   dotnet run

### 3. Running the Blazor App
Before running the web app, you must generate the model file.
1. Navigate to the Navigate to the web app directory:
   ```bash
   cd SentimentWebApp
   dotnet run

### Open your browser to http://localhost:{PortNumber} (or the port specified in your console).
